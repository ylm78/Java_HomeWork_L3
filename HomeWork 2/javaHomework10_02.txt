Homework for exceptions and internal classes:


1) Create a java class MyNumbers that has integer array. The the constructor of MyNumbers should receive the number of the elements in the array of MyNumbers.
Write a setter and a getter for the elements of the array.
The setter and the getter should check if the index that the user has provided is ok
And the setter should also check if there are duplicates. If the number provided already exists it should not insert it again.
Write a function in the class that returns the average of the array.

Create your own exceptions - throw one if the array index is not ok, and a different one if the user tried to enter the same number twice.

2) - Write a Vehicle class defined by vehicType and vehicNom of String type in which there is an
internal motor class such that each vehicle is associated with a motor of type motorType. The
motor is said to be "Large" if the type of vehicle it is associated with is "4WD" and its name is
"Crysler", "Small" otherwise.
- - The number of doors of a vehicle is equal to the number of passenger doors and the trunk. Write
the internal static Door class defined by passengerdoor and trunk and a getTotalDoors() method
that returns the total number of doors in the vehicle.
- - What happens if we try to access from getTotalPortes() one of the attributes of Vehicle?
- Write the main program which allows to test these 3 classes.


3)
Write an Enterprise class. A company has a number of employees, a capital, a name, a mission, and a
public String mission() method which returns the company's mission and declares the
SecretMissionException to be thrown. We will also have a public int capital() method which returns the
capital and which declares the throwing of the exception NonProfitException.
- Write a class EntrepriseSecret which inherits from Entreprise and whose mission() method launches
the exception SecretMissionException when the mission is not specified because it is secret.
- Write a class EntrepriseSansProfit which inherits from Entreprise and whose capital() method launches
the NonProfitException exception when the company has no capital.
- Write a method that takes a table of companies as input and displays the mission and the capital of all the companies (when possible).
- Test the method on the companies ”Ford”, ”CIA”, ”Spectre”, ”CroixRouge”, ”Microsoft”, ”Efrei”.
