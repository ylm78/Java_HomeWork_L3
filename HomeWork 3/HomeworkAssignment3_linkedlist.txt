Exercise:
Create a java program that stores students in a doubly linked list (which you have to create manually).
The students have a name, an ID and an email address.

The students are stored in a doubly linked list (one that stores the previous and the next variable as well).
The functions that your class should be able to perform:
addToFront(Student)
addToBack(Student)
remove(Student_by_id)
find(student_name)
modifyEmail(student_name)
printStudents()
printStudentsBackwards()

Extra features that you might try to implement:
- the same ID number should not be accepted
- store the Students sorted to make search faster
- with the sorted students start the search in the middle

Create additional classes if you need - and if you have any other interesting ideas then implement those as well.
